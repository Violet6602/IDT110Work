<p>Somebody once told me that the world was gonna roll me<br>I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br> She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>In the shape of an "l" on her forehead</p>
<p>Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>So much to do, so much to see<br>So whats wrong with taking the backstreets<br>Never know if you don't go<br>Never shine if you don't glow.
</p>
<p>Hey now, you're an all star get your game on, go play<br>Hey now you're a rockstar, get the show on, get paid<br>And all that glitters is gold<br>Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
